Hi Pangolin Team,

I'm Thomas from the Danish Covid19 Genome Consortia (DCGC, see covid19genomics.dk for details).
DCGC is responsible for sequencing of covid19 cases and also make genomics data available to 
the Danish health authorities.
 
Feel free to contact me on my e-mail: tym@bio.aau.dk if needed.

--Intro---
I'm contacting you as we are seeing an interesting novel lineage having the E484K mutation, 
thats has been expanding over the past weeks. As it bears the E484K we are concerned about it's 
ability to evade vaccines (antigen tests have been initiated). 
We would love to have some nomenclature for this lineage, to assist furhter genomic and epidemiological 
investigations. I appologize beforehand for not having performed robust phylogenetic analysis, but time 
is critical and we're working as fast as possible to investigate this. 

OBS: All sequences have just been deposited on GISAID. Their name is in the "gisaid-id.tsv" file. 

---Definition---
We currently define this lineage as having the E484K and F888L mutations in the S protein. All the sequences
gets assigned as B.1 and one as B.1.117. 

---Genomic---
I checked the global build on nextstrain, if you colour by genotype in the S protein at position 484 and 888
you can already see a few samples from mainly Nigeria clustering together as a quite different outgroup compared to 
other sequences:
https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?c=gt-S_484,888&m=div

I also typed them using nextclade which places them om a global tree. They are all placed together at same spot as the already
existing ones with quite long branches. See the figure "placement-global-tree-nextclade.png".

---Epidemiology---
It was first discovered in week 2 and been increasing since then 
[week 2: 2 (0.1%), week 3: 5 (0.2%), week 4: 12 (0.5%), week 5: 16 (2.6%)].
Cases are epidemiologically linked, both temporal and spatial. Due to GDPR I cannot give more detail on that.

Looking forward to hear from you!
